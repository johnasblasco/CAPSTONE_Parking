# PURPOSE: 
Parking Database System for managing the records of the incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking house. It's easy for the Admin to retrieve the data; if the vehicle has been visited through its number, he can get that data.

Nowadays, parking is a major issue in a lot of public venues, including markets, hospitals, shopping centers, multiplex systems, and businesses. There are numerous lanes and parking spaces in the vehicle parking area. So, one must scan all of the lanes in order to park a car. It also requires a significant amount of investment and manual labor. It is possible to park the car affordably, safely, and securely instead of having it towed.

The aim of this project is to develop a Parking Database System that facilitates vehicle control and time management using semi automated number plate recognition. The system will keep track of vehicles coming and going from the parking lot, compile a record of all the automobiles there, and assess whether the parking lot full or not.
