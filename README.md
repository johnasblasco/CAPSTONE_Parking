# PURPOSE: 
Parking Database System for managing the records of the incoming and outgoing vehicles in a parking house. It's easy for the Admin to retrieve the data; if the vehicle has been visited through its number, he can get that data.

Nowadays, in many public places such as malls, multiplex systems, hospitals, offices, and market areas, there is a crucial problem of vehicle parking. The vehicle parking area has many lanes/slots for car parking. So, to park a vehicle, one has to look through all the lanes. Moreover, this involves a lot of manual labor and investment. Instead of the vehicle being caught in towing, the vehicle can park safely and securely at a low cost.

The objective of this project is to build a Parking Database System that enables the time management and control of vehicles using number plate recognition. The system will track the entry and exit of cars, maintain a listing of cars within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not.
